      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello everyone, this is my first post. I am doing the Protocol Deep Dive: DNS course on Pluralsight by Betty DuBois. It was very well explained — the course duration is 2h 21mins but she gives so much relevant information I take almost 1–2 hours to do a 20 min video.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In my attempts to sharpen my tcpdump skills, I decided to look at the packet examples both in Wireshark and tcpdump to decipher the tcpdump gibberish I saw and also dive deeper into the DNS packets.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
